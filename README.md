## Brief
### Project Brief

This project is a group challenge to work to a deliverable with time constraints, providing a robust deployment with consistent method and CI pipeline.
A monthly estimate of cost should be made for the projects, risks should be assessed and issues and improvements discussed. We should implement a Webhook with GitSCM to enable rolling updates when code is pushed to the repository. We should justify our usage of chosen technologies; and provide multiple environment support for both testing and live.
